# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setup
GitHub GraphQL API needs authentication and I have chosen the PAT key based access control (How to create PAT key for GitHub: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token). Too setup the app before running, edit the .env file and add a GitHub PAT token to it (REACT_APP_GITHUB_PAT_KEY). Once done, follow the following steps:

1. Go to project directory and execute `npm install`
2. While in project directory and execute `npm start`
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
4. To run the tests execute `npm test`
